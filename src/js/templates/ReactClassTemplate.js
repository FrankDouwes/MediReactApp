      // it returns the same result each time it's invoked, and it does not read from or write
      // to the DOM or otherwise interact with the browser (e.g., by using setTimeout).
 
      // If you need to interact with the browser, perform your work in componentDidMount() or the other lifecycle methods instead.
      // Keeping render() pure makes server rendering more practical and makes components easier to think about.
